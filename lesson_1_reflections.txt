Git course reflections 
why diff
* the differnces were highlighted easily
* time was saved by not doing things manually
* at a glance i can see what was changed

version control a better programmer
* ability to review changes
* learn from own mistakes
* improve effciency
* be able to backtrack thought process

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
* pro granular control/ logical choice of times/ ability to describe units
* con possibility of human error (too many or too few)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
* due to the interconnected nature of the material

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
* git log to see all changes made with their commit messages
* git diff to compare and see what was changed if something went amiss

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
* any change can be tracked down and undone if necessary

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
* text files
* android and java learing
* android apps
