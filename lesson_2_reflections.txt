What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? 
*git init - initialize new repository
*git status - check which files have been changed since last commit
*.git folder is created
* we do this to be able to track changes from that point on

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
* it's a temporary holding area for file changes to be commited
* it makes it possible to review what you are about to commit to reduce user error
