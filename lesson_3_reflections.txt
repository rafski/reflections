When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
* if you are collaborating with others/ using multiple machines/ to keep a backup in a secure location

* git add remote origin ulr
* git push origin branch
* git pull origin branch

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
* to maintain control and to ensure that you avoid possible conflicts

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
* forks a copy on gitHub your changes will not affect the original repo
* clone a direct copy locally or from remote pusing will change original repo
* branch a side path from the original code will not affect original branch but may be merged back

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
* you can resolve any potential conflicts locally before pushing

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
* you could make changes than send the files over to collaborator and diff them it would be definitly harder than using git

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
* if you have multiple people working on a project and their work could overlap
* if you are adding potentialy breaking changes
* new feature
